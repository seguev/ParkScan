Ever stared blankly at a complex parking sign, unsure if you can park there or not? ðŸš—ðŸ¤”

That's why we created ParkScan, a convenient app that takes the guesswork out of parking.

### **How it Works**

**Scan:** Simply point your camera at the parking sign. When ParkScan will detect a sign, it will pop a capture button.

**Adjust:** Make sure the image is clear and the text is readable! Only then, press Capture.

**Parse:** Our advanced natural language processing algorithms will analyze the sign's rules and restrictions.

**Decide:** ParkScan will provide one of three potential answers: Forbidden, Paid or Free, followed by a short explanation.
